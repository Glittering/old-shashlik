This file describes how to build the Shashlik android simulated environment.



Getting the Sources
===================

Shashlik uses Dalvik, the Android runtime interpreter, to run the
applications.  In addition to Dalvik itself we need to have a number of
dependencies from the Google Android source tree to be able to build
it. 

Dalvik is normally built inside the full Android source tree and we want to
minimize the dependency tree when building on a normal Linux system. Here is
the list of sources that are necessary to build Shashlik. For each component
below you should be able to just cut and paste the command lines into a shell.

The source trees should be placed next to each other in a common subdirectory,
e.g. $HOME/SHASHLIK or something similar.  In the rest of this file we will
assume that you are using this location.  If not, you will have to adjust the
instructions below accordingly.,

  cd
  mkdir SHASHLIK
  cd SHASHLIK

Create the main directory for the sources. We recommend using a separate
directory for the source tree because you will also have the install directory
at this level (see below under Building the sources).

  mkdir src
  cd src

Then proceed to download the git and svn repositories as follows.  


1. The 4 repositories from the Shashlik project on github.

Shashlik has 3 repos from the Google Android source copied into Github. These
3 repos are Dalvik, Android Core and Android Libcore. The changes in these
repositories will be kept as small as possible so that it will be easier to
upgrade to a later version later. The main code written for Shashlik is
created in the 4th repository of the project named (surprise!) shaslik.

The main page of the project is https://github.com/shashlik. Here you will
find links to all 4 repositories. Since the shashlik repos are private you
will need to give your username and password to clone them.

  git clone https://github.com/shashlik/shashlik.git
  git clone https://github.com/shashlik/dalvik.git
  git clone https://github.com/shashlik/android-core.git
  git clone https://github.com/shashlik/android-libcore.git


2. frameworks-base

  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base frameworks-base


3. safe-iop

Safe IOP is also a Google library which is described like this on the project
home page at https://code.google.com/p/safe-iop/

    This library provides a collection of (macro-based) functions for
    performing safe integer operations across platform and architecture with a
    straightforward API.

It is kept in subversion. To check it out, do the following:

  svn checkout http://safe-iop.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ safe-iop
  cd safe-iop
  svn switch http://safe-iop.googlecode.com/svn/tags/r0.3.1

We will use a specific release, in this case 0.3.1, to get a stable platform.
This is the reason for the svn switch.


4. libnativehelper

Libnativehalper is another library from Google which is necessary to build
Dalvik. It contains support functions for Android's class libraries. This one
is kept in git.

  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libnativehelper

This repository is used without modification, and the master branch is tracked.


5. bionic

Bionic is a derivation of the BSD's standard C library code that was
originally developed by Google for their Android[2] operating system
(Wikipedia). It is a stripped-down version of libc that contains exactly what
is needed on Android. It is necessary to build Dalvik, although there is a
project to port Dalvik to GNU libc.

There is a project called dvk (https://code.google.com/p/dvk/) whose goal is
to port dalvik to other CPU architectures and away from needing bionic but we
have not gone down that route.

  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic


5. skia

Skia is a 2D graphics library used in Chromium.  The project page can be found
at http://code.google.com/p/skia/ .

  git clone https://skia.googlesource.com/skia.git



Building the sources
====================

The goal of Shashlik is to create a stand-alone Android runtime
environment. This basically means Dalvik with a number of support features
such as emulated sensors and a screen.

Dalvik itself needs a number of support classes and libraries from the Android
sources. Unfortunately the dependencies themselves drag in more dependencies
and so on until most of Android is present. It turns out that Dalvik itself
does not use that many classes and functions in the dependency libraries so by
selecting to build only those classes that are actually needed.


NOTE: At the point of writing this, Dalvik is not yet building correctly so
      the instructions below will be updated when we get more of it building
      and working.


In this description we assume that you have downloaded the sources above and
that they are all in $HOME/shashlik. See also the comment about this topic
above.

At this time the instructions assume that you are building on a standard Linux
desktop system with an installed software development kit. Refer to your
distribution on how to install this. As far as we know there are no
distribution specific problems or peculiarities.


Branches
--------

We are trying to minimize the changes in each component as much as
possible. However some changes are necessary and cannot be avoided. So for
each dependency that does need to be changed, we have created a branch called
shashlik-kitkat. 

Some of the components have release tags that we are using so that we can have
a stable build.  Here is a list of the branches and tags that we are using:

* dalvik: 	      branch shashlik-kitkat
* android-core:       branch shashlik-kitkat
* android-libcore:    branch shashlik-kitkat

* frameworks-base     branch shashlik-kitkat
* safe-iop: 	      tag http://safe-iop.googlecode.com/svn/tags/r0.3.1
* libnativehelper:    branch kitkat-release

The repo shashlik itself is the one where we try to put all of our changes so
that should be on master branch unless you are working on some feature that is
using its own branch.


Building
--------

Building Shashlik is slightly more complicated than building a normal source
tree. This is because we are taking sources from the Android source tree and
build them in a way that they are not designed for.

What you need to do is to first build _and_ _install_ the libraries that can
be built by themselves.  We call these tier1 libraries. Then you will use
these installed tier1 libraries to build the ones that depend on them, which
we call tier2 libraries.  After these tier1 and 2 libraries are built, you can
build the actual tools and applications that make up the Shashlik project.

Because of the above, you need to create a separate install directory.  We
recommend SHASHLIK/install.  Note that the install directory should be
_outside_ the shashlik repo source tree but under the SHASHLIK top directory.

  mkdir install

We recommend that you create 2 directories: one for the dependencies from the
Android sources as described above and one for the code that actually resides
in the shashlik repo. Here we call them builddeps and build respectively.  So
in the top directory of the SHASHLIK project tree, do:

  cd shashlik
  mkdir builddeps
  mkdir build

In the builddeps directory, create one subdirectory for each subdirectory of
shashlik/buildsystem/. At the point of writing this is tier1 and tier2. So you
will have builddeps/tier1/ and builddeps/tier2/. 

  mkdir -p builddeps/tier1
  mkdir -p builddeps/tier2

The sources must be built and installed in the order indicated by the name and
is done by cmake. So from the topdirectory of shashlik, do

  (cd builddeps/tier1; cmake ../../buildsystem/tier1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/SHASHLIK/install && make install)
  (cd builddeps/tier2; cmake ../../buildsystem/tier2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/SHASHLIK/install && make install)

...and so on if there are more than 2 subdirectories of ../../buildsystem.

This will create a series of subdirectories, one for each shared library and
binary artifact required. They will be built in the order of dependencies,
building up a working system one piece at a time.

All components in tier1 rely on only 'normal' Linux system libraries (libc,
etc).  Components in tier2 are libraries that rely on components in tier1, and
tier3 contains the various executables built on top of tier2/tier1 libraries.
