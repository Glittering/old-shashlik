The buildsystem contained here is meant to be used to build a set of git
repositories which are forks of their Android counterparts or the upstream
versions themselves on a "normal" desktop-oriented Linux distribution.

The shashlik repository must be in a directory alongside the following
repositories:

* shashlik/android-core
    branch: shashlik-kitkat
* shashlik/android-libcore
    branch: shashlik-kitkat
* shashlik/dalvik
    branch: shashlik-kitkat
* safe-iop (http://code.google.com/p/safe-iop/)
    tag: http://safe-iop.googlecode.com/svn/tags/r0.3.1
* libnativehelper (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libnativehelper)
    branch: kitkat-release

The paths in the CMakeLists.txt files all assume this relative positioning of
repositories.

To start the build, create a build directory (e.g. shashlik/build) that
contains one subdirectory for each of the tierN directories in
shashlik/buildsystem. Change into each of these tier directories in order
(tier1, tier2, .. tierN) and start cmake pointed to the buildsystem
directories of the same name.

This will create a series of subdirectories, one for each shared library and
binary artifact required. They will be built in the order of dependencies,
building up a working system one piece at a time.

All components in tier1 rely on only 'normal' Linux system libraries (libc,
etc).  Components in tier2 are libraries that rely on components in tier1, and
tier3 contains the various executables built on top of tier2/tier1 libraries.
