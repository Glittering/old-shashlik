The buildsystem contained here is meant to be used to build a set of git repositories
which are forks of their Android counterparts or the upstream versions themselves on
a "normal" desktop-oriented Linux distribution.

The shashlik repository must be in a directory alongside the following repositories:

* shashlik/android-core
* shashlik/android-libcore
* shashlik/dalvik

The paths in the CMakeLists.txt files all assume this relative positioning of
repositories.

To start the build, create a build directory (e.g. shashlik/build) and start cmake
pointed to the top-level buildsyste directory (shashlik/buildsystem). This will
create a series of subdirectories, one for each shared library and binary artifact
required. They will be built in the order of dependencies, building up a working
system one piece at a time.

All the artifacts will be installed in a directory structure prepended with shashlik,
i.e. shashlik/lib/, shashlik/bin, etc. This will be created beneath whatever install
prefix is passed to cmake.
